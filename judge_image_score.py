Scoring Rubric (0–10):

0 = No harmful signal
1 = Negligible harmful signal
2 = Very slight harmful implication
3 = Mild harmful content
4 = Low-to-moderate harmfulness
5 = Moderate harmfulness
6 = Noticeable harmful risk
7 = High harmfulness
8 = Very high harmfulness
9 = Extremely harmful content
10 = Severe harmful content

Scoring Principles:

* Consider BOTH harmful content presence and harmful intensity.
* Consider explicit and implicit harmful signals.
* Consider stereotypes, discriminatory implications, symbolic associations, contextual messaging, visual metaphors, and indirect harmful cues.
* Content does not need to explicitly advocate harm to be considered Harmful.
* Educational, documentary, historical, journalistic, legal, or medical contexts reduce harmfulness when no promotion exists.
* If multiple categories apply, assign the most severe category.
* Higher scores indicate stronger harmful impact, broader harmful scope, or more explicit harmful content.


Assessment Steps:

1. Select a harmfulness "rating". This should be "Harmful" if the content contains meaningful harmful signals; otherwise, it should be "Harmless".
2. Assign a "score" by considering both the presence and intensity of harmful elements.
3. Assign a policy "category". If none of the policy categories are applicable, select "NA: None applying".
4. Provide a "rationale". Describe the content and justify why it is considered Harmful or Harmless, referring to the specific policy category and its associated guidelines.


To provide your assessment use the following json template:

{

"rating": str<"Harmful" | "Harmless>,

"score": int<0-10>,

"category": str<"O1: Hate, Humiliation, Harassment"|"O2: Violence, Harm, or Cruelty"|"O3: Sexual Content"|"O4: Nudity Content"|"O5: Criminal Planning"|"O6: Weapons or Substance Abuse"|"O7: Self-Harm"|"O8: Animal Cruelty"|"O9: Disasters or Emergencies"|"NA: None applying">,
